  <h1>Introducing Correx</h1>

  <p>
    Thanks for trying Correx.news, the ASU News Co/Lab's new corrections tool. Our goal is to help
    you easily send corrections and major updates down the same social media pathways that the
    original stories traveled.
  </p>

  <p>
    Correx is based on several notions: First, we believe that forthright corrections are a
    fundamental, essential part of journalistic transparency. Second, we can help automate the
    process of sending them down those social media pathways -- to alert people who'd shared the
    original articles that there was a correction or significant update. Finally, we hope to help
    the news industry (and others who believe in the best journalistic principles) come up with a
    standard for creating and publishing corrections.
  </p>

  <h1>How it Works</h1>

  <p>Search for a story to submit a correction or followup for:</p>
  <img src="/screenshots/search-dan-example.png" alt="Search for a story example" width="50%" />

  <p>
    Select the target post for a followup or correction. This may be one or more Twitter or Reddit
    posts that have shared the story. You can switch between Reddit and Twitter search results by
    clicking the respective button.

  <p>
    Compose the followup or correction by clicking the followup button and replying to the selected
    post individually.
