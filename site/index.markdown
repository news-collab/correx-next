# Introducing Correx

Thanks for trying Correx.news, the ASU News Co/Lab's new corrections tool. Our goal is to help you easily send corrections and major updates down the same social media pathways that the original stories traveled.

## Correx is based on several notions

*First*, we believe that forthright corrections are a fundamental, essential part of journalistic transparency.

*Second*, we can help automate the process of sending them down those social media pathways -- to alert people who'd shared the original articles that there was a correction or significant update. Finally, we hope to help the news industry (and others who believe in the best journalistic principles) come up with a standard for creating and publishing corrections.

You can find the source code for [Correx](https://www.github.com/news-collab/correx-next) on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/).

# How it Works

Search for a story to submit a correction or followup for:

![Search for a story](/assets/screenshots/search-dan-example.png)

Select the target post for a followup or correction. This may be one or more Twitter or Reddit posts that have shared the story. You can switch between Reddit and Twitter search results by clicking the respective button.

Compose the followup or correction by clicking the followup button and replying to the selected post individually.
