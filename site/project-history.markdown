# History

Correx started as a project of [News Co/Lab](https://newscollab.org/) at Arizona State University led by Dan Gillmor and Ted Han to help newsrooms make corrections and updates to their news stories. 

Development has continued under direction of Caige Nichols and Master's student Prajyot Dhotre.

The project is now open-source and [available](https://www.github.com/news-collab/correx-next) on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/). The project can always use more contributors -- [learn how](https://github.com/news-collab/correx-next#contributing) to get started.
